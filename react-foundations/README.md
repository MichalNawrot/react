## notes

> **Imperative programming** is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza.
> **Declarative programming** is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza.

- when iterating over an array React will give us a warning about a missing `key` prop. This is because React needs something to uniquely identify items in an array so it knows which elements to update in the DOM.
- In React, event names are *camelCased*. The `onClick` event is one of many possible events you can use to respond to user interaction. For example, you can use `onChange` for input fields or `onSubmit` for forms.

### Three core concepts `Components`, `props`, `State`

- Components
  - components are functions that returns UI elements
  - should be capitalized to distinguish them from plain HTML and JavaScript
  - use React components the same way you'd use regular HTML tags, with angle brackets <>
- Props
  - props are passed to components as the first function parameter
- State
  - the state is initiated and stored within a component.
  - You can pass the state information to children components as props, but the **logic for updating the state should be kept within the component** where state was initially created.
  - Hooks allow you to add additional logic such as state to your components.
  - Think of state as any information in your UI that changes over time, usually triggered by user interaction.

### Server and Client Components

To understand how `Server` and `Client Components` work, it's helpful to be familiar with two foundational web concepts:

- The [environments](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/server-and-client-components#server-and-client-environments) your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.
  - Behind the scenes, the components are split into two module graphs. The `server module graph` (or tree) contains all the Server Components that are rendered on the server, and the `client module graph` (or tree) contains all Client Components.
  - The **client** refers to the browser on a userâ€™s device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response it receives from the server into an interface the user can interact with.
  - The **server** refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, does some computation, and sends back an appropriate response.
    - After Server Components are rendered, a special data format called the React Server Component Payload (RSC) is sent to the client.
      - The RSC payload contains:
        1. The rendered result of Server Components.
        2. Placeholders (or holes) for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files.


- The [network boundary](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations/server-and-client-components#network-boundary) that separates server and client code.
